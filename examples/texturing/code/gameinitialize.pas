{ Game initialization.
  This unit is cross-platform.
  It will be used by the platform-specific program or library file.

  Feel free to use this code as a starting point for your own projects.
  This template code is in public domain, unlike most other CGE code which
  is covered by BSD or LGPL (see https://castle-engine.io/license). }

uses SysUtils,
  CastleWindow, CastleLog, CastleUIControls

  // The content here may be automatically updated by CGE editor.
  , GameViewMain
  {$endregion 'Castle Initialization Uses'};

var
  Window: TCastleWindow;

{ One-time initialization of resources. }
procedure ApplicationInitialize;
begin
  { Adjust container settings for a scalable UI (adjusts to any window size in a smart way). }
  Window.Container.LoadSettings('castle-data:/CastleSettings.xml');

  { Create TViewMain that will handle "main" view of the game.
    Larger games may use multiple views,
    e.g. TViewMainMenu ("main menu view"),
    TViewPlay ("playing the game view"),
    TViewCredits ("showing the credits view") etc. }
  {$region 'Castle View Creation'}
  // The content here may be automatically updated by CGE editor.
  ViewMain := TViewMain.Create(Application);
  {$endregion 'Castle View Creation'}

  Window.Container.View := ViewMain;
end;

initialization
  { Initialize Application.OnInitialize. }
  Application.OnInitialize := @ApplicationInitialize;

  { Create and assign Application.MainWindow. }
  Window := TCastleWindow.Create(Application);
  Window.ParseParameters; // allows to control window size / fullscreen on the command-line
  Application.MainWindow := Window;

  { Adjust window fullscreen state and size.
    Note that some platforms (like mobile) may ignore it.
    Examples how to set window fullscreen state and size:

      Window.FullScreen := true;

    or

      Window.FullScreen := false; // default
      Window.Width := 600;
      Window.Height := 400;

    or

      Window.FullScreen := false; // default
      Window.Width := Application.ScreenWidth * 2 div 3;
      Window.Height := Application.ScreenHeight * 2 div 3;
  }

  { You should not need to do *anything* more in the unit "initialization" section.
    Most of your game initialization should happen inside ApplicationInitialize.
    In particular, it is not allowed to read files before ApplicationInitialize
    (because in case of non-desktop platforms,
    some necessary resources may not be prepared yet). }
